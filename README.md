# Personal dotfiles
This repository contains the configuration files I use in both desktop & laptop devices.

### What is a 'dotfile'?
The term `dotfile` refers to hidden config files from most apps on GNU+Linux systems, like Bash (`.bashrc`) or Vim (`.vimrc`). Notice the `.` at the start of the name file, thus 'dotfile' :). They are hidden by default in most file explorers by default, like Nautilus.
